# Pink Noise Generator ğŸ©·ğŸ”‰ğŸ©·ğŸ”ŠğŸ©·ğŸ”‰ğŸ©·
This is just a simple pink noise Generator.

It plays full-spectrum pink noise in the browser, with a little display of the spectrum to give you some visual confirmation of what it's generating.

I built it for the purpose of measuring the frequency response of some microphones I own.
